        <p>
            Hi! I’m <strong>Ariyan Pradhan</strong>, an undergraduate student passionate about technology and coding.
            I enjoy learning new things, solving problems, and building small creative projects.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Game development</strong> is my favorite hobby — I love experimenting with <em>Godot</em> and creating
            2D games that mix design and logic. Games like <em>Hollow Knight</em> and <em>Celeste</em> inspire me to make
            meaningful and fun experiences.
            <br><br>
            My goal is to grow as a developer, build cool projects, and keep exploring the world of tech and GameDev.
